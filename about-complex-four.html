      <h1>About Complex Four</h1>
      <p class="lead muted">
        A simple explanation of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase): what it does, why “electron leakage” happens,
        and how oxidative stress fits into ageing research.

      <h2>Mitochondria in 30 seconds</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Mitochondria are your cells’ energy factories. They use nutrients + oxygen to create ATP (usable energy).
        This happens along a “conveyor belt” called the electron transport chain (ETC), which helps build a proton gradient
        that powers ATP synthase.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section grid-2">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Where Complex IV sits</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Complex IV is near the end of the ETC. It takes electrons (delivered via cytochrome c) and uses them to reduce oxygen into water.
          At the same time, it helps maintain the proton gradient that drives ATP production.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Why it’s called “Complex Four”</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          The ETC includes multiple large protein “complexes.” Complex IV is the final major step before oxygen is turned into water.
          That final step matters because it’s where oxygen is handled directly.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section card">
      <h2>Electron leakage and ROS (in plain English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Ideally, electrons move smoothly along the ETC. But biology is messy:
        sometimes electrons “slip” and react early with oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide.
        In many textbooks and reviews, the biggest ROS “hot spots” are discussed around Complex I and III,
        especially under certain conditions (high membrane potential, inhibited flow, or altered substrate balance).
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Key idea:</strong> ROS isn’t automatically “bad.” Cells use redox signals on purpose.
        The problem is when ROS production chronically exceeds antioxidant capacity — that’s oxidative stress.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section card">
      <h2>Why this shows up in ageing research</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Many ageing models involve a feedback loop: mitochondrial efficiency declines, ROS handling worsens,
        and damage accumulates (proteins, lipids, DNA), which can further impair mitochondria.
        Large reviews discuss mitochondria as both a major ROS source and a major ROS target,
        linking mitochondrial dysfunction + oxidative stress to many age-related biological changes.
      </p>
      <p class="fineprint">
        This is a research framework, not a diagnosis. Human biology is multi-factorial and individual.
      </p>

    <section class="section card">
      <h2>So… why “Complex Four” as a brand?</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Because it’s a memorable way to point to the mitochondria — energy, oxygen use, and redox balance —
        without making medical promises. We focus on: clear education, careful language, and practical wellness routines.
